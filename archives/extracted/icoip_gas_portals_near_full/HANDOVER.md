# ICOIP GAS 5-Portal Near-Full Demo Pack

This pack upgrades the earlier CRUD demos into **client-facing near-full demos** across 5 separate standalone Google Apps Script projects.

## Included portals
1. Volunteer Management Portal
2. Intake & Referral Portal
3. Counselling & Client Portal
4. Admin Portal
5. AI Training & Curriculum Development Portal

## Major upgrade scope
- demo login with 4 roles
- permissions-aware UI
- workflow action buttons per portal
- attachments sheet + Google Drive upload
- notifications sheet + email send
- print / PDF-style record page
- richer record workspace modal
- audit log and activity feed
- reset demo data action for Admin

## Important honesty note
This is **near-full demo**, not production security:
- no real authentication
- no server-signed sessions
- no row-level restriction
- no PDPA redaction layer
- no advanced approval engine
- no real AI generation for training outputs yet

## Recommended next upgrade
If needed next:
- one **master ICOIP suite** with module switcher
- real login and RBAC
- cross-portal linked records
- dashboard charts
- PDF export engine
- calendar + email + workflow automation
